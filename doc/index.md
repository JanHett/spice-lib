# spice. An image processing library.

spice-lib is an image processing library that is designed to be easy to use by being both opinionated and pluggable. In other words, spice-lib tries not to make assumptions about what happens outside its API, but inside it uses specific types, relies on specific memory layouts etc.

It exists for two reasons:

1. I liked but didn't love any of the existing C++ image processing libraries I tried
2. I like to understand things from the ground up, even if that means re-writing the same idea four times over (yes, this is iteration number four)
