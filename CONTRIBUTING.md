# Contributing to spice-lib

If you found this project useful enough to add your two cents (or lines of code), please do!

Here's a few ways you can have a part in driving this library forward:

- use it, note what's working and what isn't and tell me about it
- review the code
- propose a specific fix or - even better...
- submit a pull request

If you submit a pull request, make sure all added functionality is thoroughly (unit) tested.

If you spot a bug or a vulnerability, please [create an issue](https://github.com/JanHett/spice/issues/new) describing the malfunction. I will do my best to look into it within a few days.
